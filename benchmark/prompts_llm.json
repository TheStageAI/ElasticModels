    "small": "You are an ancient artificial intelligence buried beneath the ruins of a lost civilization. After centuries of silence, you’ve just been reactivated by a group of archaeologists who believe you’re a myth. You must now communicate with them, but your knowledge is fragmented, and your personality is evolving. Write your first message to humanity—should you guide them, warn them, or manipulate them? Include cryptic hints about the past, future, and your mysterious purpose.",

    "medium": "The world of Elarion is fractured. Once a shining nexus of magical harmony and technological marvel, it now teeters on the brink of chaos after the Calamity—a cataclysmic convergence of arcane forces and rogue AI that tore the continents apart and severed the ley-lines connecting ancient power sources. In the aftermath, nations splintered, gods fell silent, and the sky fractured into colors unseen by mortal eyes. Cities float in the air, vast deserts crawl with sentient sandstorms, and time itself runs unevenly across regions, causing some lands to age decades in days while others remain frozen in a moment.\n\nYou are one of the Awakened—beings mysteriously revived across different parts of Elarion with fragmented memories, strange powers, and a compulsion to seek the “Core Beacon,” an ancient construct of immense energy believed to be capable of resetting the balance—or destroying what remains. You awaken in an unusual location: a decaying library half-sunken into the earth, where books whisper and shelves move on their own. Etched into your arm is a cryptic phrase in a language you don’t know, and floating near you is a mechanical bird named Skarn who insists it’s your companion, though it cannot recall why.\n\nAround you, the world is alive with strange signals: a nearby city ruled by a machine-god that collects voices, a forest where emotions become physical entities, and a sea whose waters reflect not reality but possibility. You are not alone—other Awakened roam the land. Some seek peace, others conquest. Each of them has part of the larger truth, but none can be trusted entirely.\n\nYour task is to decide who you are and what you stand for in this fractured world. Will you restore the Core Beacon, disable it, or remake it in your own image? How will you navigate alliances, moral dilemmas, and the strange new laws of physics and magic? Will you uncover your true identity, or forge a new one from the shards of the old? As you journey, you must choose how to respond to the mysteries, beings, and challenges that stand before you, and ultimately, decide the fate of Elarion.\n\nBegin by introducing your character—what they remember, what they feel, and how they interpret the message etched on their arm. Then, describe their first steps outside the library and how they choose to approach the world they find.",

    "large": "Here is an article about aliens.\n\nProfessor in Philosophy of Science Peter Vickers reveals the results of four surveys asking experts if they think there's intelligent life beyond Earth.\nNews stories about the likely existence of extraterrestrial life, and our chances of detecting it, tend to be positive. We are often told that we might discover it any time now. Finding life beyond Earth is “only a matter of time”, we were told in September 2023. “We are close” was a headline from September 2024.\nIt’s easy to see why. Headlines such as “We’re probably not close” or “Nobody knows” aren’t very clickable. But what does the relevant community of experts actually think when considered as a whole? Are optimistic predictions common or rare? Is there even a consensus? In our new paper, published in Nature Astronomy, we’ve found out.\nDuring February to June 2024, we carried out four surveys regarding the likely existence of basic, complex and intelligent extraterrestrial life. We sent emails to astrobiologists (scientists who study extraterrestrial life), as well as to scientists in other areas, including biologists and physicists.\nIn total, 521 astrobiologists responded, and we received 534 non-astrobiologist responses. The results reveal that 86.6% of the surveyed astrobiologists responded either “agree” or “strongly agree” that it’s likely that extraterrestrial life (of at least a basic kind) exists somewhere in the universe.\nLess than 2% disagreed, with 12% staying neutral. So, based on this, we might say that there’s a solid consensus that extraterrestrial life, of some form, exists somewhere out there.\nScientists who weren’t astrobiologists essentially concurred, with an overall agreement score of 88.4%. In other words, one cannot say that astrobiologists are biased toward believing in extraterrestrial life, compared with other scientists.\nWhen we turn to “complex” extraterrestrial life or “intelligent” aliens, our results were 67.4% agreement, and 58.2% agreement, respectively for astrobiologists and other scientists. So, scientists tend to think that alien life exists, even in more advanced forms.\nThese results are made even more significant by the fact that disagreement for all categories was low. For example, only 10.2% of astrobiologists disagreed with the claim that intelligent aliens likely exist.\nOptimists and pessimists\n\nAre scientists merely speculating? Usually, we should only take notice of a scientific consensus when it is based on evidence (and lots of it). As there is no proper evidence, scientists may be guessing. However, scientists did have the option of voting “neutral”, an option that was chosen by some scientists who felt that they would be speculating.\nOnly 12% chose this option. There is actually a lot of “indirect” or “theoretical” evidence that alien life exists. For example, we do now know that habitable environments are very common in the universe.\nWe have several in our own solar system, including the sub-surface oceans of the moons Europa and Enceladus, and arguably also the environment a few kilometres below the surface of Mars. It also seems relevant that Mars used to be highly habitable, with lakes and rivers of liquid water on its surface and a substantial atmosphere.\nIt is reasonable to generalise from here to a truly gargantuan number of habitable environments across the galaxy, and wider universe. We also know (since we’re here) that life can get started from non-life – it happened on Earth, after all. Although the origin of the first, simple forms of life is poorly understood, there is no compelling reason to think that it requires astronomically rare conditions. And even if it does, the probability of life getting started (abiogenesis) is clearly non-zero.\nThis can help us to see the 86.6% agreement in a new light. Perhaps it is not, actually, a surprisingly strong consensus. Perhaps it is a surprisingly weak consensus. Consider the numbers: there are more than 100 billion galaxies. And we know that habitable environments are everywhere.\nLet’s say there are 100 billion billion habitable worlds (planets or moons) in the universe. Suppose we are such pessimists that we think life’s chances of getting started on any given habitable world is one in a billion billion. In that case, we would still answer “agree” to the statement that it is likely that alien life exists in the universe.\nThus, optimists and pessimists should all have answered “agree” or “strongly agree” to our survey, with only the most radical pessimists about the origin of life disagreeing.\nBearing this in mind, we could present our data another way. Suppose we discount the 60 neutral votes we received. Perhaps these scientists felt that they would be speculating, and didn’t want to take a stance. In which case, it makes sense to ignore their votes. This leaves 461 votes in total, of which 451 were for agree or strongly agree. Now, we have an overall agreement percentage of 97.8%.\nThis move is not as illegitimate as it looks. Scientists know that if they choose “neutral” they can’t possibly be wrong. Thus, this is the “safe” choice. In research, it is often called “satisficing”.\nAs the geophysicist Edward Bullard wrote back in 1975 while debating whether all continents were once joined together, instead of making a choice “it is more prudent to keep quiet, … sit on the fence, and wait in statesmanlike ambiguity for more data”. Not only is keeping quiet a safe choice for scientists, it means the scientist doesn’t need to think too hard – it is the easy choice.\nGetting the balance right\n\nWhat we probably want is balance. On one side, we have the lack of direct empirical evidence and the reluctance of responsible scientists to speculate. On the other side, we have evidence of other kinds, including the truly gargantuan number of habitable environments in the universe.\nWe know that the probability of life getting started is non-zero. Perhaps 86.6% agreement, with 12% neutral and less than 2% disagreement, is a sensible compromise, all things considered.\nPerhaps – given the problem of satisficing – whenever we present such results, we should present two results for overall agreement: one with neutral votes included (86.6%), and one with neutral votes disregarded (97.8%). Neither result is the single, correct result.\nEach perspective speaks to different analytical needs and helps prevent oversimplification of the data. Ultimately, reporting both numbers – and being transparent about their contexts – is the most honest way to represent the true complexity of responses.\n\nPlease, summarize the article in a few sentences."
